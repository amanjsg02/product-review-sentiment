This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline built to classify product reviews as either positive or negative based on their content. 
The application uses a Bag of Words model and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to analyze and predict sentiment from customer feedback.
It is deployed via a simple Flask API, making it easy to integrate with other services or front-end interfaces.
> ⚠️ Note: After cloning, you must place `model.pkl` and `select.pkl` into the project folder manually.
